# aroworkshop.io

This is the repository for the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Workshop website.

## Technology

- The website is statically built using Jekyll and youâ€™ll find the different pages inside the `_entries` folder
- You can preview your edits locally if you run `make build-run` inside the repository root
- The build pipeline builds Docker images of the site and hosts it on a private repository on Azure Container Registry (`msworkshops.azurecr.io`)
- The website is running on an [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/)
- The `master` branch gets deployed to the production slot [aroworkshop.io](http://aroworkshop.io)
- The `staging` branch gets deployed to the staging slot [staging.aroworkshop.io](http://staging.aroworkshop.io)
