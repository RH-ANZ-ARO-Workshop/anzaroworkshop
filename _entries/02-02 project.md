### Open Web Terminal in web console and create project

{% collapsible %}

Once you're logged into the Web Console, click on the **Web Terminal icon** at the top right. This will open a panel at the bottom prompting you to create your first project. In the **Project name** field, enter **workshop<student#>** using your student number as the suffix.

> **Note** For example, if you are student 15, the entry would be workshop15

Once you click start, the Web Terminal will automatically be connected to the project you just created. You'll notice the Web Console updates with that project as well.
